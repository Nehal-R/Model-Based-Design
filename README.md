# Model-Based Design (MBD) – MATLAB Learning Portfolio

## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Model-Based Design (MBD) using MATLAB.
It contains structured lab exercises that focus on building strong foundations in matrix operations, numeric data types, array manipulation, and basic system modeling.

The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, demonstrate technical skills, and build a professional portfolio in preparation for advanced work in control systems, robotics, and simulation.

## Tools Used

* MATLAB
* Matrix operations
* Numeric array manipulation
* Built-in MATLAB functions

---

## Repository Structure

Each lab is organized into three parts:

* **code/** → MATLAB scripts (.m files)
* **results/** → Screenshots of outputs and plots
* **report/** → Short written explanation of what was learned

This structure reflects a real engineering workflow:
Write code → Run simulation → Analyze results → Document learning

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a technical portfolio that shows:

* Continuous learning
* Practical MATLAB experience
* Strong understanding of matrix operations
* Engineering documentation skills
