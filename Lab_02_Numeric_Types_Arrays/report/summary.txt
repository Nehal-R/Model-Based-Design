LAB 02 – MATLAB Numeric Types and Array Manipulation

Objective:
The goal of this lab was to understand MATLAB numeric data types, create arrays, and use special matrix functions.

What I did:
- Created integer and double variables.
- Checked data types using the class function.
- Created vectors for even numbers and prime numbers.
- Generated an identity matrix and a magic square.
- Performed horizontal and vertical matrix concatenation.

What I learned:
This lab improved my understanding of MATLAB data types, array creation, and matrix operations. I learned how to use built-in MATLAB functions and combine matrices in different ways.
