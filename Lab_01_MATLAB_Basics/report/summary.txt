LAB 01 – MATLAB Numeric Arrays and Basic Operations

Objective:
The purpose of this lab was to practice basic MATLAB skills including creating numeric arrays, performing matrix operations, concatenating vectors, and using built-in functions.

What I did:
- Created 3x3 matrices and performed matrix addition.
- Displayed results using MATLAB commands.
- Created row and column vectors.
- Performed horizontal concatenation.
- Used the repmat function to repeat a matrix pattern.
- Created an identity matrix.
- Performed matrix multiplication.

What I learned:
This lab helped me understand how MATLAB handles matrices, vectors, and basic operations. I learned how to manipulate arrays, perform calculations, and visualize results using simple scripts.
